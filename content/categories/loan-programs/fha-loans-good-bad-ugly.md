FHA loans are marketed as "easy to qualify" — and they are. But there's a catch that catches many borrowers off guard: **mandatory mortgage insurance that doesn't go away.**

## The FHA Promise

- 3.5% down payment
- Credit scores as low as 580 (10% down if 500-579)
- More flexible on credit events (bankruptcies, foreclosures)
- Assumable (great when rates rise)

Sounds great, right? Here's the catch.

## The Mortgage Insurance Problem

### Upfront MIP
- **0.15%** of loan amount (most borrowers)
- **1.75%** for score below 580
- This is added to your loan cost

### Monthly MIP
- **0.55%** for most loans (annual)
- For a $300,000 loan, that's **$138/month**
- **It lasts the ENTIRE loan** — not until you hit 20% equity

### Comparison: FHA vs. Conventional

| $300K Loan, 10% Down | FHA | Conventional |
|---------------------|-----|--------------|
| Rate | 6.0% | 6.25% |
| P&I | $1,797 | $1,943 |
| MI | $138 | ~$100 |
| **Total** | **$1,935** | **$2,043** |

FHA looks cheaper here... **but wait.**

**Conventional PMI goes away at 20% equity. FHA MIP lasts forever.**

Over 5 years:
- Conventional: ~$6,000 in PMI
- FHA: ~$8,280 in MIP

## When FHA Makes Sense

- Credit under 620 (conventional tough to get)
- Recent bankruptcy (3 years vs. 4-7 for conventional)
- Gift funds for down payment (FHA more flexible)
- Buying a fixer-upper (203k renovation loans)

## When to Avoid FHA

- Credit 620+ (conventional likely cheaper long-term)
- Planning to stay short-term (5 years or less)
- Can afford 20% down (skip PMI entirely)
- Higher credit score (gets you better PMI rates)

## The Bottom Line

FHA isn't "bad" — it's a tool. But it's not always the "cheap" option, despite the lower down payment. Get the full picture before deciding.
