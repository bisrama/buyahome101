Being self-employed has perks — but when it comes to getting a mortgage, it can feel like an uphill battle. **Good news:** There are options designed specifically for entrepreneurs and business owners.

## The Freddie Mac 5-Year Rule

Here's something many borrowers don't know about:

> **If you've been in business for 5+ years, Freddie Mac may only require 1 year of tax returns instead of 2.**

This is a game-changer for established business owners who had a slower first year or are investing heavily in growth.

### How It Works:

| Traditional Requirement | Freddie 5-Year Option |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 2 years of tax returns | **1 year** of tax returns |
| 2-year income average | Most recent year only |
| Must show 2-year trend | Shows current business health |

## Why This Matters

Many self-employed borrowers have legitimate income but show lower earnings on paper due to:

- **Business deductions** — Write-offs reduce taxable income
- **Reinvested profits** — Money put back into the business
- **Startup phase** — Early years may show losses

The Freddie Mac 5-year rule recognizes that a single slow year doesn't define a healthy, established business.

## Qualifying for This Program

To use the 1-year option, you typically need:

- ✅ **5+ years** in the same business (verified via tax returns, business licenses, etc.)
- ✅ **1 year** of self-employment income on federal tax returns
- ✅ **Profitable** in the most recent year (or explainable loss)
- ✅ **Good credit** — Generally 620+, higher scores get better rates

## Other Self-Employed Options

If you don't qualify for the Freddie 5-year program, there are other paths:

### Bank Statement Loans
- Use 12-24 months of **business or personal bank statements** instead of tax returns
- Lenders calculate income from deposits
- Great for high earners with low documented income

### Asset-Based Qualification
- **Asset depletion** — Use savings/investments to qualify
- **No income verification** — Some programs skip income entirely

### Non-QM Programs
- Bank statement programs
- P&L (Profit & Loss) statements with CPA verification
- DSCR for investment properties (more on this below)

## Investment Properties: No Income Verification?

If you're looking at **investment properties**, there's an option that doesn't require proving income at all:

### DSCR Loans (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)

**DSCR loans qualify you based on the property's cash flow — not your personal income.**

- ✅ **No W-2s, tax returns, or pay stubs needed**
- ✅ **Based on rental income potential**
- ✅ **Great for investors** with multiple properties or high deductions

### How DSCR Works:

```
DSCR = Net Operating Income / Debt Service
```

If the property rents for more than the mortgage payment, you qualify. Simple.

### Typical DSCR Requirements:

- **Credit:** 620-700+ (varies by lender)
- **Down payment:** 20-30% for investment properties
- **DSCR ratio:** Usually 1.0+ (some go as low as 0.75)
- **Property types:** Single-family, multi-family, condos
