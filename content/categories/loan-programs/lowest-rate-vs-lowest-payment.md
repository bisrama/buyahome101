Everyone wants the lowest interest rate. That's natural — it's what mortgage ads talk about. **But lowest rate doesn't always mean lowest payment.**

Here's a secret the industry doesn't advertise: **Mortgage insurance can add 1% or more to your actual rate.**

## The Problem with "Rate Shopping"

When borrowers ask "What's your rate?", they're thinking about the note rate. But there's another cost hiding in plain sight:

**Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)**

- Required on conventional loans with less than 20% down
- Required on FHA loans (upfront + monthly)
- Can range from **0.5% to 2%+** of your loan amount annually

## Real Example: Conventional vs. Non-QM

Let's say you're buying a $350,000 home with 10% down:

| Scenario | Conventional (Fannie/Freddie) | Non-QM |
|----------|------------------------------|--------|
| **Loan Amount** | $315,000 | $315,000 |
| **Interest Rate** | 6.25% | 6.75% |
| **Principal & Interest** | $1,943 | $2,041 |
| **Mortgage Insurance** | ~$263/mo (0.8%) | $0 |
| **Total Monthly** | **$2,206** | **$2,041** |

**The Non-QM loan saves you $165/month — despite the higher rate.**

## Why This Matters

- **PMI is not temporary** — It stays until you hit 20% equity
- **FHA is worse** — Upfront MIP (1.75%) + monthly MIP
- **Credit scores under 720** — PMI starts climbing steeply
- **Rate ads are misleading** — They rarely mention PMI

## When Non-QM Makes Sense

Consider non-QM if:

- ✅ Credit is 620-740 (higher PMI zone)
- ✅ You have cash flow but complex income
- ✅ You want to avoid mortgage insurance entirely
- ✅ You plan to refinance in 3-5 years
- ✅ You're an investor with rental properties

## The Real Question to Ask

Don't ask: *"What's your rate?"*

Ask: **"What's my total monthly payment, including all fees and insurance?"**

That's the number that matters. And sometimes, a slightly higher rate with no PMI beats a lower rate with expensive mortgage insurance.
