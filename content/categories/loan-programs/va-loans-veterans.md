If you're a veteran or active-duty service member, the VA loan is probably the best mortgage product available. Period.

## Why VA Loans Rock

- **0% down** — Zero. Nothing. Buy a home with no money down
- **No PMI** — Unlike conventional and FHA, no monthly mortgage insurance
- **Competitive rates** — Usually lower than conventional
- **Flexible credit** — More forgiving than conventional
- **Assumable** — Transfer the loan to another eligible veteran
- **No prepayment penalty** — Pay off early, no fees

## Who Qualifies?

- Active-duty service members
- Veterans with honorable discharge
- National Guard members (after 6 years)
- Surviving spouses of service members who died in line of duty

### Service Requirements
- 90 days of active service during wartime
- 181 days during peacetime
- National Guard: 6 years (or 90 days under Title 32)

## The Funding Fee

The VA charges a one-time **funding fee** (0.5% - 3.6% of loan amount) instead of PMI.

| Down Payment | First-Time Use | Subsequent Use |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| 0% | 2.15% | 3.3% |
| 5%+ | 1.5% | 1.5% |
| 10%+ | 1.25% | 1.25% |

**This fee can be financed into the loan.**

Disabled veterans? **Exempt from funding fee.**

## VA Loan Limits

In most counties, you can borrow up to **$726,200** (2024) with no money down. In high-cost areas, limits go higher.

Above those limits, you'll need to make a down payment.

## Refinance Options

- **Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan (IRRRL)** — Streamline refinance, minimal documentation
- **Cash-Out Refinance** — Tap up to 100% of your equity

## The Bottom Line

If you served, VA loans are gold. Zero down, no PMI, great rates. It's one of the few true benefits of military service — use it.
