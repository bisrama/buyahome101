Buying your first home is a major milestone — and it can feel overwhelming. But with the right information, you can navigate the process with confidence.

## 1. Invest in Homeownership Education

Before diving in, take time to understand the basics:

- A **mortgage** is a loan for buying a house that you pay back over time with interest
- Most buyers put down **3%–20%** upfront and finance the rest
- **30-year mortgages** offer lower payments but more interest over time
- **15-year mortgages** have higher payments but save thousands in interest

Consider taking a [home buying education class](https://example.com) — some down payment assistance programs actually require it.

### Ask Yourself:

- ✅ Am I ready to commit to this home for at least 5 years?
- ✅ Do I have an emergency fund covering 3 months of expenses?
- ✅ Do I have stable income?
- ✅ Do I have enough for a down payment (plus closing costs)?

If you answered "yes" to these, you're ready to start!

## 2. Explore First-Time Buyer Programs

You may qualify for programs that make buying more affordable:

- **State/Local Assistance** — Many states offer down payment assistance, closing cost aid, and grants
- **Fannie Mae HomePath** — Up to 3% of purchase price toward closing costs after completing a home buyer education course
- **Good Neighbor Next Door** — Teachers, firefighters, police, and EMTs can get discounts in revitalization areas
- **MCC Tax Credits** — Mortgage Credit Certificates let you claim a credit on mortgage interest

## 3. Know the Difference: Prequalified vs. Preapproved

| Prequalification | Preapproval |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Estimate of what you can afford | Official document from a lender |
| Based on self-reported info | Based on verified documents |
| Good for early shopping | Strengthens your offer |

**Preapproval** shows sellers you're a serious, qualified buyer — gives you a competitive edge.

## 4. Understand Your Loan Options

- **Conventional** — As little as 3% down, but usually requires 620+ credit
- **FHA** — 3.5% down with 580+ credit, more flexible on credit history
- **VA** — 0% down for veterans and active military
- **USDA** — 0% down for rural/suburban areas (income limits apply)

## 5. Save for Down Payment — and Closing Costs

Don't forget: **closing costs are 3%–6%** of the loan amount, separate from your down payment.

### Ways to Boost Your Savings:

- Automate transfers to a dedicated savings account
- Reduce discretionary spending
- Explore down payment assistance programs
- Ask about seller concessions

## 6. Check Your Credit

Before applying:

- **Don't open new credit** — New loans/credit cards affect your score
- **Pay down balances** — Lower utilization improves your score
- **Dispute errors** — Check your report for mistakes

## 7. Find the Right Real Estate Agent

Your agent should:

- Have experience in your target neighborhoods
- Communicate clearly and frequently
- Understand your needs and budget
- Provide references from past clients

## 8. Make a Smart Offer

- Don't stretch beyond your budget — being "house poor" is stressful
- Earnest money is typically 1%–3% of the price
- Include an inspection contingency to protect yourself

## 9. Get the Home Inspected

A home inspection identifies issues like:

- Electrical problems
- Plumbing leaks
- Roof or foundation concerns
- HVAC issues

**Appraisal** protects the lender; **inspection** protects you.

## 10. Plan for Maintenance

Create a savings buffer for repairs. A good rule: budget 1% of your home's value annually for maintenance.
