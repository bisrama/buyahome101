Your down payment isn't the only cash you need. **Closing costs** are 3-6% of your loan amount — and they're due at settlement.

## What Are Closing Costs?

Closing costs are fees for services required to complete your loan. They cover:

- Lender fees
- Third-party services
- Government recording
- Title insurance

## Typical Cost Breakdown

On a $350,000 loan (~$10,500 - $21,000 total):

| Fee | Typical Cost |
|-----|-------------|
| **Loan Origination** | 0.5% - 1% ($1,750 - $3,500) |
| **Appraisal** | $400 - $600 |
| **Credit Report** | $30 - $50 |
| **Title Insurance** | $800 - $2,500 |
| **Title Search** | $200 - $400 |
| **Attorney Fees** | $500 - $1,500 |
| **Survey** | $300 - $800 |
| **Recording Fees** | $50 - $150 |
| **Escrow Deposits** | 2-6 months property taxes & insurance |
| **Discount Points** | 0 - 2% (optional) |
| **Prepaid Interest** | Varies |

## How to Reduce Closing Costs

### 1. Negotiate with Lender
Ask for a "no-cost" or "low-cost" loan. They may cover costs in exchange for a slightly higher rate.

### 2. Seller Concessions
In a buyer's market, sellers may cover part of your closing costs. Negotiate in your offer.

### 3. Compare Lenders
Closing costs vary between lenders. Get Loan Estimates from 3+ lenders.

### 4. Timing
Closing at the end of the month reduces prepaid interest.

### 5. Discount Points
Paying points upfront lowers your rate. Run the math to see if it makes sense.

## What's NOT Included

These are separate from closing costs:

- **Down payment** (3-20%+ of purchase price)
- **Moving expenses**
- **Furniture/appliances**
- **Initial repairs** (if needed)

## Estimate Your Costs

Rule of thumb: Budget **3%** of purchase price for closing costs on conventional loans. FHA/VA may be slightly higher.

**Example:**
- Home price: $300,000
- Down payment (10%): $30,000
- Closing costs (3%): $9,000
- **Cash to close: $39,000**

## Don't Forget Escrow

You'll also need to set up an escrow account for:
- Property taxes (1-2% of home value annually)
- Homeowners insurance ($1,000 - $2,000/year)
- Mortgage insurance (if applicable)

Lenders require 2-6 months of these in advance.
