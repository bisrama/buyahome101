Saving for a down payment is the #1 hurdle for first-time home buyers. But did you know there are **hundreds of programs** that can help?

## What is Down Payment Assistance?

Down payment assistance (DPA) programs provide:

- **Grants** — Money you never have to repay
- **Forgivable loans** — No repayment if you stay in the home long enough
- **Low-interest loans** — Affordable second mortgages
- **Tax credits** — Savings on your tax bill

## Who Qualifies?

Each program has its own rules, but common requirements:

- First-time home buyer (or haven't owned a home in 3+ years)
- Income limits (varies by location and family size)
- Credit score requirements (often 620+)
- Complete a home buyer education course
- Property must be your primary residence

## Types of Down Payment Assistance

### 1. Grants (Free Money!)

- **Florida First** — Up to $10,000 for down payment + closing costs
- **California CHDAP** — Up to 3% of loan amount
- **Texas DHAP** — Varies by area

### 2. Forgivable Second Mortgages

- 0% interest
- Forgiveness after 5-10 years of living in the home
- No monthly payments

### 3. Deferred Payment Loans

- No payments while you live in the home
- Due when you sell, refinance, or pay off the mortgage
- Usually 0-3% interest

### 4. Employer Assistance

- Some employers offer down payment help
- Check with your HR department
- Particularly common in education, healthcare, and government

## How to Find Programs

### 1. State Housing Finance Agencies
Every state has an HFA that administers DPA programs. Google "[Your State] down payment assistance program"

### 2. Local Governments
Cities and counties often have their own programs, especially for first-time buyers.

### 3. HUD
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lists resources at [hud.gov](https://hud.gov)

### 4. Ask Your Lender
Good lenders know the programs in their area and can match you with options.

| Loan Type | DPA Compatible |
|-----------|----------------|
