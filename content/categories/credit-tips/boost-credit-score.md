Your credit score directly affects your mortgage rate. A 720 score vs. 680 could mean **0.5% - 1% lower rate** — that's **$100+ per month** on a $300,000 loan.

Here's how to boost your score before applying.

## Quick Wins: 30-60 Days

### 1. Check Your Reports
Get free reports at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com). Dispute errors — they happen more often than you think.

### 2. Pay Down Credit Cards
**Utilization matters.** Keep balances below 30% of limits. Better: below 10%.

### 3. Don't Close Old Cards
Length of credit history = points. Keep old accounts open, even if unused.

### 4. Become an Authorized User
Got a family member with good credit? Being added as an authorized user can boost your score.

### 5. Don't Apply for New Credit
Every inquiry drops your score 2-5 points. Stop applying for cards, loans, or financing.

## Medium-Term: 3-6 Months

### 6. Pay Bills On Time
Payment history is 35% of your score. Set up autopay.

### 7. Catch Up Delinquencies
Past-due accounts hurt. Bring them current.

### 8. Reduce Debt
Lower overall debt-to-limit ratio = higher score.

## Understanding Credit Scores

| Score Range | Rating | Impact |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 800+ | Exceptional | Best rates |
| 740-799 | Very Good | Great rates |
| 670-739 | Good | Moderate rates |
| 580-669 | Fair | Higher rates |
| Below 580 | Poor | Limited options |

## Mortgage-Specific Tips

### DTI Matters Too
Lenders look at debt-to-income ratio. Keep debts low relative to income.

### Credit Mix Helps
Having both revolving (cards) and installment (auto loans) accounts can help — but don't buy a car just for this.

### Don't Co-Sign
Co-signing ties their debt to your report. If they miss payments, your score drops.

## How Much Can You Save?

| Score | Rate (30yr Fixed) | Payment on $300K | Monthly Savings |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 640 | 7.5% | $2,098 | — |
| 680 | 6.75% | $1,947 | $151 |
| 720 | 6.25% | $1,847 | $100 |
| 760 | 6.0% | $1,796 | $51 |

**20-point boost = ~$100/month savings**
