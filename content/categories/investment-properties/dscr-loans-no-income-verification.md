Want to buy rental properties but don't want to jump through hoops proving your personal income? **DSCR loans** might be exactly what you need.

## What is a DSCR Loan?

**DSCR = Debt Service Coverage Ratio**

Instead of verifying your personal income (W-2s, tax returns, pay stubs), lenders look at whether the **property itself** generates enough cash flow to cover the mortgage.

### The Simple Formula:

```
Monthly Rent > Monthly Mortgage Payment = Approved
```

If the property rents for more than it costs to finance, you qualify. It's that straightforward.

## Who DSCR Loans Are Perfect For

- ✅ **Real estate investors** building a portfolio
- ✅ **Self-employed** individuals with high deductions
- ✅ **Business owners** with complex tax situations
- ✅ **Anyone wanting to invest** without documenting income

## DSCR Loan Requirements

| Factor | Typical Requirement |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Credit Score** | 620-700+ |
| **Down Payment** | 20-30% (investment properties) |
| **DSCR Ratio** | 1.0+ (some lenders accept 0.75+) |
| **Property Type** | Single-family, multi-family, condos, townhomes |
| **Loan Amount** | Usually $125K+ (varies by lender) |

## Why Investors Love DSCR

1. **No income docs** — Skip the tax return gymnastics
2. **Fast approval** — Less documentation = faster closing
3. **Scale up** — Easy to buy multiple properties
4. **Flexible** — Refinance or purchase new properties

## Types of DSCR Loans

### Fixed-Rate DSCR
- 30-year fixed rates
- Predictable payments
- Best for long-term hold strategies

### DSCR ARMs
- Adjustable rates (usually 5/6 or 7/1)
- Lower initial rates
- Good if you plan to sell or refinance in a few years

### Cash-Out DSCR
- Pull equity out of existing properties
- Use for repairs, upgrades, or new purchases

## Calculating DSCR

**Example:**

- Property purchase price: $300,000
- Down payment (25%): $75,000
- Loan amount: $225,000
- Monthly PITIA: $1,800
- Projected rent: $2,400

```
DSCR = $2,400 / $1,800 = 1.33
```

**Result:** 1.33 > 1.0 → **Approved!**

## Investment Property Strategy

DSCR loans are ideal for:

- **House hacking** — Live in one unit, rent others
- **BRRRR method** — Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat
- **Multi-family** — 2-4 units under one loan
- **Long-term rentals** — Build passive income

## Things to Know

- **Interest rates** are slightly higher than traditional loans (offset by no income verification)
- **Reserves** — Some lenders require 6+ months reserves
- **Appraisal** — Must confirm rental income potential
