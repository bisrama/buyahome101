        <p>Buying your first home is a major milestone — and it can feel overwhelming. But with the right information, you can navigate the process with confidence.</p>
<h2 id="1-invest-in-homeownership-education">1. Invest in Homeownership Education</h2>
<p>Before diving in, take time to understand the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>mortgage</strong> is a loan for buying a house that you pay back over time with interest</li>
<li>Most buyers put down <strong>3%–20%</strong> upfront and finance the rest</li>
<li><strong>30-year mortgages</strong> offer lower payments but more interest over time</li>
<li><strong>15-year mortgages</strong> have higher payments but save thousands in interest</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider taking a <a href="https://example.com">home buying education class</a> — some down payment assistance programs actually require it.</p>
<h3 id="ask-yourself">Ask Yourself:</h3>
<ul>
<li>✅ Am I ready to commit to this home for at least 5 years?</li>
<li>✅ Do I have an emergency fund covering 3 months of expenses?</li>
<li>✅ Do I have stable income?</li>
<li>✅ Do I have enough for a down payment (plus closing costs)?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to these, you&rsquo;re ready to start!</p>
<h2 id="2-explore-first-time-buyer-programs">2. Explore First-Time Buyer Programs</h2>
<p>You may qualify for programs that make buying more affordable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>State/Local Assistance</strong> — Many states offer down payment assistance, closing cost aid, and grants</li>
<li><strong>Fannie Mae HomePath</strong> — Up to 3% of purchase price toward closing costs after completing a home buyer education course</li>
<li><strong>Good Neighbor Next Door</strong> — Teachers, firefighters, police, and EMTs can get discounts in revitalization areas</li>
<li><strong>MCC Tax Credits</strong> — Mortgage Credit Certificates let you claim a credit on mortgage interest</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-know-the-difference-prequalified-vs-preapproved">3. Know the Difference: Prequalified vs. Preapproved</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prequalification</th>
<th>Preapproval</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Estimate of what you can afford</td>
<td>Official document from a lender</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Based on self-reported info</td>
<td>Based on verified documents</td>

<tr>
<td>Good for early shopping</td>
<td>Strengthens your offer</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Preapproval</strong> shows sellers you&rsquo;re a serious, qualified buyer — gives you a competitive edge.</p>
<h2 id="4-understand-your-loan-options">4. Understand Your Loan Options</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conventional</strong> — As little as 3% down, but usually requires 620+ credit</li>
<li><strong>FHA</strong> — 3.5% down with 580+ credit, more flexible on credit history</li>
<li><strong>VA</strong> — 0% down for veterans and active military</li>
<li><strong>USDA</strong> — 0% down for rural/suburban areas (income limits apply)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-save-for-down-payment--and-closing-costs">5. Save for Down Payment — and Closing Costs</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget: <strong>closing costs are 3%–6%</strong> of the loan amount, separate from your down payment.</p>
<h3 id="ways-to-boost-your-savings">Ways to Boost Your Savings:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Automate transfers to a dedicated savings account</li>
<li>Reduce discretionary spending</li>
<li>Explore down payment assistance programs</li>
<li>Ask about seller concessions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-check-your-credit">6. Check Your Credit</h2>
<p>Before applying:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t open new credit</strong> — New loans/credit cards affect your score</li>
<li><strong>Pay down balances</strong> — Lower utilization improves your score</li>
<li><strong>Dispute errors</strong> — Check your report for mistakes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-find-the-right-real-estate-agent">7. Find the Right Real Estate Agent</h2>
<p>Your agent should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have experience in your target neighborhoods</li>
<li>Communicate clearly and frequently</li>
<li>Understand your needs and budget</li>
<li>Provide references from past clients</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-make-a-smart-offer">8. Make a Smart Offer</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t stretch beyond your budget — being &ldquo;house poor&rdquo; is stressful</li>
<li>Earnest money is typically 1%–3% of the price</li>
<li>Include an inspection contingency to protect yourself</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-get-the-home-inspected">9. Get the Home Inspected</h2>
<p>A home inspection identifies issues like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrical problems</li>
<li>Plumbing leaks</li>
<li>Roof or foundation concerns</li>
<li>HVAC issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Appraisal</strong> protects the lender; <strong>inspection</strong> protects you.</p>
<h2 id="10-plan-for-maintenance">10. Plan for Maintenance</h2>
<p>Create a savings buffer for repairs. A good rule: budget 1% of your home&rsquo;s value annually for maintenance.</p>
