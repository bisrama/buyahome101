        <p>Being self-employed has perks — but when it comes to getting a mortgage, it can feel like an uphill battle. <strong>Good news:</strong> There are options designed specifically for entrepreneurs and business owners.</p>
<h2 id="the-freddie-mac-5-year-rule">The Freddie Mac 5-Year Rule</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s something many borrowers don&rsquo;t know about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;ve been in business for 5+ years, Freddie Mac may only require 1 year of tax returns instead of 2.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a game-changer for established business owners who had a slower first year or are investing heavily in growth.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>Many self-employed borrowers have legitimate income but show lower earnings on paper due to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business deductions</strong> — Write-offs reduce taxable income</li>
<li><strong>Reinvested profits</strong> — Money put back into the business</li>
<li><strong>Startup phase</strong> — Early years may show losses</li>
</ul>
<p>The Freddie Mac 5-year rule recognizes that a single slow year doesn&rsquo;t define a healthy, established business.</p>
<h2 id="qualifying-for-this-program">Qualifying for This Program</h2>
<p>To use the 1-year option, you typically need:</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>5+ years</strong> in the same business (verified via tax returns, business licenses, etc.)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>1 year</strong> of self-employment income on federal tax returns</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Profitable</strong> in the most recent year (or explainable loss)</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Good credit</strong> — Generally 620+, higher scores get better rates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-self-employed-options">Other Self-Employed Options</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t qualify for the Freddie 5-year program, there are other paths:</p>
<h3 id="bank-statement-loans">Bank Statement Loans</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use 12-24 months of <strong>business or personal bank statements</strong> instead of tax returns</li>
<li>Lenders calculate income from deposits</li>
<li>Great for high earners with low documented income</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asset-based-qualification">Asset-Based Qualification</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asset depletion</strong> — Use savings/investments to qualify</li>
<li><strong>No income verification</strong> — Some programs skip income entirely</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-qm-programs">Non-QM Programs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bank statement programs</li>
<li>P&amp;L (Profit &amp; Loss) statements with CPA verification</li>
<li>DSCR for investment properties (more on this below)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id="investment-properties-no-income-verification">Investment Properties: No Income Verification?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking at <strong>investment properties</strong>, there&rsquo;s an option that doesn&rsquo;t require proving income at all:</p>
<h3 id="dscr-loans-debt-service-coverage-ratio">DSCR Loans (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)</h3>
<p><strong>DSCR loans qualify you based on the property&rsquo;s cash flow — not your personal income.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong>No W-2s, tax returns, or pay stubs needed</strong></li>
<li>✅ <strong>Based on rental income potential</strong></li>
<li>✅ <strong>Great for investors</strong> with multiple properties or high deductions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-dscr-works">How DSCR Works:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>DSCR = Net Operating Income / Debt Service
</code></pre><p>If the property rents for more than the mortgage payment, you qualify. Simple.</p>
<h3 id="typical-dscr-requirements">Typical DSCR Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit:</strong> 620-700+ (varies by lender)</li>
<li><strong>Down payment:</strong> 20-30% for investment properties</li>
<li><strong>DSCR ratio:</strong> Usually 1.0+ (some go as low as 0.75)</li>
<li><strong>Property types:</strong> Single-family, multi-family, condos</li>
</ul>
