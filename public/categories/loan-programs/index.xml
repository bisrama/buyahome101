But there&amp;rsquo;s a catch that catches many borrowers off guard: mandatory mortgage insurance that doesn&amp;rsquo;t go away.&#xA;The FHA Promise 3.5% down payment Credit scores as low as 580 (10% down if 500-579) More flexible on credit events (bankruptcies, foreclosures) Assumable (great when rates rise) Sounds great, right?
